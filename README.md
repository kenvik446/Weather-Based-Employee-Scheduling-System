# Weather-Based-Employee-Scheduling-System
**Overview**
The Weather-Based Employee Scheduling System is a tool designed to optimize staffing levels in a retail environment based on current weather conditions. By leveraging real-time weather data, this system helps employers make informed decisions about employee scheduling to ensure efficient operation and maximize profit.

**Features**

Weather Integration: Uses the Weather API to fetch real-time weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Dynamic Staffing Recommendations: Provides staffing recommendations based on the weather forecast, adjusting the number of employees needed for optimal efficiency.
User Input: Allows users to input their city, country code, and the total number of employees scheduled to work.
Automated Calculations: Automatically calculates the number of employees needed based on weather conditions, helping to ensure that the business is neither overstaffed nor understaffed.
Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to enhance scheduling efficiency and improve workforce management in retail stores. By aligning employee shifts with anticipated customer volume influenced by weather conditions, the system aims to maximize operational efficiency, reduce labor costs, and ensure adequate staffing levels during peak times.

**Who Needs It**

This system is ideal for:

1. Retail Store Managers and Business Owners: Who need to schedule part-time employees effectively.

2. Restaurants and Cafes: To ensure sufficient staff during busy times and reduce overstaffing during slow periods.
3. Event Venues: To manage staff for outdoor events where weather conditions significantly impact attendance.
4. Entertainment Centers: To optimize employee schedules in places like amusement parks, cinemas, and museums, where visitor numbers fluctuate with the weather.

**How It Works**

Input Data: Users input their city, country code, and the total number of employees scheduled to work.
Fetch Weather Data: The system fetches real-time weather data from the Weather API.
Calculate Staffing Needs: Based on the weather conditions, the system calculates the number of employees needed:
Good Weather: Higher customer turnout, necessitating more staff.
Bad Weather: Fewer customers, resulting in fewer employees needed.
Display Recommendations: The system provides staffing recommendations based on the forecasted weather.
